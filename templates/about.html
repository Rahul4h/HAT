    <strong>small and independent online sellers</strong> across the country.

  <h4>🎯 Our Mission</h4>
  <p>
    To enable every small business owner to sell online with complete freedom — without the burden of high courier charges or the risk of fraudulent deliveries.

  <h4>💡 What Makes Us Unique</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>🧺 Personal Delivery System:</strong> 
      Sellers can assign their <strong>own delivery personnel</strong> to complete orders — avoiding third-party courier fees and delays. 
      This brings down costs and boosts control.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>🤝 Dual Confirmation System:</strong> 
      Our innovative <strong>delivery confirmation process</strong> requires verification from both the 
      <strong>customer and the delivery person</strong> before marking any order as “Delivered.” 
      This ensures transparency and protects both sides from disputes and scams.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>🎁 "Only For You" – Intelligent Product Suggestions:</strong> 
      HAT uses advanced <em>Market Basket Analysis</em> to power the <strong>"Only For You"</strong> section on the homepage. 
      This smart algorithm suggests the best products based on each customer’s shopping behavior, creating a personalized shopping experience.
